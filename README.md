# regular-scraper
BeautifulSoup template with very basics (fetches url's, captures screenshot).
Use it as a template, you are free to do anything you will since I really do not care.

If you want to save scraped url's and screenshots, you need to create 2 directories in the master directory; ["scraped-screenshots/", "scraped-text"]

Have a good day.
